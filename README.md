3. Saving the notes to a database if they so desire it.

4. Empty the fields in order to write a new note.

5. Select an already saved note from the rendered list of notes retrieved from the database in order to inspect it on the note-pad area to the right.

6. Delete an already saved note if the user no longer has any use for it.
