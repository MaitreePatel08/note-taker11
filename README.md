# note-taker11

This Note Taker app was created with the purpose of providing busy people with an easy and reliable way to keep track of their to-dos, thoughts, appointments, etc. By accessing it online, the user will be able to do the following:

Write new notes within the provided title and text fields on the right-side of the screen.

Saving the notes to a database if they so desire it.

Empty the fields in order to write a new note.

Select an already saved note from the rendered list of notes retrieved from the database in order to inspect it on the note-pad area to the right.

Delete an already saved note if the user no longer has any use for it.

For its author, the challenge was an instructive way to :

Practice modularization as a way to implement separation of concerns when coding the back-end of the application. In this case, different endpoints get their own node module, and so do custom middleware and helper functions.

Continue learning about the connection between different methods of request (get, post, and delete) using the Fetch API on the front-end and the different routes (including some that utilize Express.js routers) defined on the back-end.
